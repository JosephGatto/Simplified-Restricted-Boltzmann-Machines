# Simplified-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines
Restricted Boltzmann Machine were tough for me to grasp at first. Here I will attempt to explain them in the simplest terms possible. A few snippets of this code were inspired by cognitiveclass.ai which is an excellet deep learning resource I highly recommend. I also think, as of now, I have the only Tensorflow implementation of Contrastive Divergence for RBMs online. Those looking for that material can skip to the end of the tutorial.
